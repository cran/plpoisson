CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.1.1

  BUG FIXES:
    o Fixed capitalized letter/typos in the description field of the 
      DESCRIPTION file.

CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.1.0

  BUG FIXES:
    o the C function `plBinom` has been fixed by implementing a
      binary search algorithm for lower and upper frequentist limits.

    o the R functions poisUNIF(), poisJEFF() and poisBayes() are now
      returning prediction limits based on the negative binomial
      quantile function.

    o useless lines of code on all R functions has been removed.

    o the argument `epsilon = NULL` has been dropped from all
      implemented functions.

CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.0.1

  NEW FEATURES:
    o the function poiss() is implemented for providing prediction
      limits for the Poisson distribution from a frequentist
      viewpoint.

    o the function poisUNIF() is implemented for providing prediction
      limits for the Poisson distribution from a Bayesian viewpoint
      by using a Uniform prior.

    o the function poisJEFF() is implemented for providing prediction
      limits for  the Poisson distribution from a Bayesian viewpoint
      by using Jeffreys prior.

    o the function poisBayes() is implemented for providing prediction
      limits for  the Poisson distribution from a Bayesian viewpoint
      by using Jeffreys prior.
