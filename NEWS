CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.3.1

BUG FIXES:

 o Edited `src/plpbootstrap.c` to use `R_Calloc` and `R_Free`.

 o Edited the file `NEWS` according to GNU standards.
 
 

CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.3.0

NEW FEATURES:
  
 o Included `src/plpbootstrap.c` to estimate hyperparameters.

 o Included `R/hyperbootstrap.R` to bootstrap hyperparameters.

BUG FIXES:

 o Edited the file `NAMESPACE` to include the function `na.omit()`
   from the `stats` package.

DOCUMENTATION:

 o Edited the `DESCRIPTION` file to include a new reference.   



CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.2.0

BUG FIXES:

 o The methodological description and references in the manual
   files for the R functions `poisBayes`, `poisUNIF` 
   and `poisJEFF` was adjusted.

 o The lower bounds provided by the R functions in the 
   files `poisBayes.R`, `poisUNIF.R` and `poisJEFF.R` have been 
   fixed.

 o The upper bounds provided by the R functions in the 
   files `poisBayes.R`, `poisUNIF.R` and `poisJEFF.R` have been
   fixed.



CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.1.1

BUG FIXES:

 o Fixed capitalized letter/typos in the description field of the 
   DESCRIPTION file.



CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.1.0

BUG FIXES:

 o The C function `plBinom` has been fixed by implementing a
   binary search algorithm for lower and upper frequentist limits.

 o The R functions poisUNIF(), poisJEFF() and poisBayes() are now
   returning prediction limits based on the negative binomial
   quantile function.

 o Useless lines of code on all R functions has been removed.

 o The argument `epsilon = NULL` has been dropped from all
   implemented functions.



CHANGES IN plpoisson 0.0.1

NEW FEATURES:

 o The function poiss() is implemented for providing prediction
   limits for the Poisson distribution from a frequentist
   viewpoint.

 o The function poisUNIF() is implemented for providing prediction
   limits for the Poisson distribution from a Bayesian viewpoint
   by using a Uniform prior.

 o The function poisJEFF() is implemented for providing prediction
   limits for  the Poisson distribution from a Bayesian viewpoint
   by using Jeffreys prior.

 o The function poisBayes() is implemented for providing prediction
   limits for  the Poisson distribution from a Bayesian viewpoint
   by using Jeffreys prior.
